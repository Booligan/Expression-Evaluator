## Usage

This program is capable of evaluating simple mathematical expressions. An example expression could look like:

"+ 1 2"

This expression can be read as 1 + 2 and evaluates to 3. We've placed the operator (+) first in our syntax to simplify some things down the road. The + indicates that this is an operator expression, and is evaluated by summing the two following tokens, which in this case are both numbers.
